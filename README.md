#Intellectual-Resume-Analyzer

The Resume Analyzer project, developed in Python using Visual Studio and employing XAMPP for local hosting, is designed to offer recruiters a robust toolset for efficient resume analysis. 

The project architecture revolves around a user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit, providing recruiters with an intuitive platform to interact with the application. Leveraging XAMPP, the local web server environment ensures seamless accessibility to the application from any web browser on the recruiter's machine.

Under the hood, the application utilizes a combination of powerful Python libraries to process resume data effectively. pdfminer3 is employed to extract text from resumes in various formats, while pyresparser enables comprehensive parsing of this extracted text to extract key information such as skills, experience, and education. 

The data is then structured and manipulated using Pandas, facilitating easy organization and analysis of candidate profiles.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities are enhanced through NLTK and Spacy libraries, enabling semantic analysis of resume content to derive deeper insights into candidate qualifications and suitability for specific roles. 

Additionally, Plotly is integrated to visualize these insights dynamically, providing recruiters with interactive charts and graphs for better understanding and comparison of candidate profiles.

For database management, Pymysql is utilized to handle CRUD operations, ensuring secure storage and retrieval of candidate information. 

Streamlit-tags further enhance user experience by enabling recruiters to categorize and tag resumes for efficient organization and retrieval.

Incorporating Pillow for image processing tasks, the application can also handle resumes containing images, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of all resume components. Overall, the Resume Analyzer project offers recruiters a powerful yet user-friendly solution for streamlining the recruitment process, enabling informed decision-making and efficient management of candidate data.
