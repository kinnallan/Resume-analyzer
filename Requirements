XAMPP:

It is a popular open-source software package that simplifies the process of setting up a local web server environment on your computer. It stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MySQL (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P). 

To create a simple webpage using XAMPP, you'll need to follow these basic steps:

Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the official website according to your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Start Apache and MySQL Servers: After installing XAMPP, start both the Apache and MySQL servers using the XAMPP Control Panel. This panel provides a user-friendly interface to manage the servers.

Create a New Folder: Create a folder in the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation. This directory is where your local web files will be served from.

Create HTML File: Inside the folder you created, create a new file with a .html extension. You can use any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) to create and edit this file.

Write HTML Code: Write the HTML code for your webpage inside the .html file.
